**Operators that could be used inside WHERE clause**

| Operator | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =        | Equal                                                                       |
| >        | Greater than                                                                |
| <        | Less than                                                                   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal                                                       |
| <=       | Less than or equal                                                          |
| <>       | Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != |
| BETWEEN  | Between a certain range                                                     |
| LIKE     | Search for a pattern                                                        |
| IN       | To specify multiple possible values for a column                            |

The WHERE clause can be combined with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

- The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
- The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
- The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
